[b]Online - Montage[/b]

Online weather report: calm skies and empty blogs. The Nebulaverse fandom as it had existed is no more. Dead blogs lay like skeletal carcasses, and broken links litter the scene like wreckages. Many people have simply moved on, either to other fandoms beyond the Nebulaverse, or away from this website altogether. The tide of art and fic have continued, but with a more somber, less triumphant tenor. There are still blogs posting new and ever more outrageous discourses, but you do not follow them.

SAT is done and my scores kind of suck! Anyway, I'm applying to colleges now! The place i'm looking at is at least 100 miles away and has in-state tuition and isn't *that* selective lol

Idk why but I feel like my parents are more... careful? around me? Like they're avoiding me or something. Especially my dad. It's honestly kind of creepy. We used to have conversations! Sure some of them degenerated into yelling sessions but at least I could tell how they felt! Of course maybe dad had an actual change of heart but nothing in my experience makes me believe he can change.

Is this because of what my siblings said to them? Did they threaten my parents? Is my dad living in fear of CPS right now? Lmao, as if CPS in Texas would ever help a trans kid instead of stealing them from accepting parents.

Anyway, I can't wait to turn 18 and get out of this place.

        @icemoongirl: i have to write an essay for a scholarship, and i've decided, what better topic to write about than the nebulaverse?

        @icemoongirl: cursed, i know.

        @icemoongirl: the topic is the same as one of the common app topics, asking about your background or interests.

        @icemoongirl: so, i've written an essay about how the nebulaverse fandom affected me, and how i ended up disconnecting from the fandom but not from the friends i made.

        @icemoongirl: i was wondering if you'd be willing to look through it?

        @icemoongirl: ofc you don't have to, but i'd be really glad if you read it and tell me what you think!

                @icemoongirl: i'm not even mentioning that i'm trans, not explicitly at least. a college essay isn't a coming out essay lol
