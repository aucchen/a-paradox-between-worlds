The camera stared into Galileo's exhausted eyes.

"What are you?" it asked, its voice mechanical and monotone.

"What do you mean?" the boy replied.

"What is the nature of your soul?"

Gali glanced around the room. It was no larger than a closet, the walls barren, the floor unadorned, save the chair he sat in and the robotic camera protruding from a wall. It was only slightly terrifying.

The robot continued speaking. "Why do you exist? What is the inalienable, unchangeable core that makes you, you?"

*page_break "I, I haven't got a clue."

"I, I haven't got a clue," the boy replied.

"Hmm." The robotic voice became louder, more ominous. "None of you do. Not yet. But I already see the hue of your spark. Yes! It's there. Tell me, Gali, why aren't you more afraid of me? You know not every pupil makes it out of this room alive."

He had no idea how to answer.

"Why aren't you terrified that the remainder of your life is being decided at this very moment?"

*page_break He really wasn't afraid.

He really wasn't afraid; somehow he knew that he would survive. Just as well, the robot continued.

"You know what you are, deep inside. You contain within you a seed, the germ of an entire story, the story of your life and the stories of your world. It will take root one day, and it will germinate, and it will change not only you but all those around you. You will become someone..."

Suddenly the room began to glow. A white light grew brighter and brighter, until Galileo had to close his eyes.

"So you see? Do you see now?"

*page_break "No, not at all."

"No, not at all," the boy muttered. "How am I supposed to see when it's so bright here?"

The door opened.

"A Keeper of Light, Galileo Nova!" The robotic voice reverberated. Claps from outside. How long had he been in there?

Help my grandmother stay alive!

Hey everyone, my abuela in Mexico has just been diagnosed with a brain tumor. There's a surgical procedure that could save her life, but they only do that procedure in a few hospitals in America, and none in Mexico. The problem is, it's going to cost us tens of thousands of dollars. I don't know if we can ever afford that.

Can anyone help us out?

So, I've spent a long time researching this theory... Please read it and tell me what you think!

Title: Gali Nova is transfem-coded and here's why:

Tl;dr: The name "Gali", being trapped in a literal closet and forced to confront your true feelings about yourself, being trapped in a closet again (on multiple occasions), feeling more at ease when around the girls up to the point of staying in their dorm (in like the most non-sexual way possible), "cross-dressing" in a way that's *not* portrayed as offensive or degrading, being naturally able to use both Light and Shadow magic, and yeah.

[b]@radical-astra:[/b]

Lol this is insane. Troons say they don't reify gender stereotypes and then say shit like this.

[b]@lunan0va:[/b]

What is your problem here? Do you have an actual point?

Okay I liked the trans girl gali headcanon so much I wrote a fic about it. It's the first time I've written fic in a while so uh. it might be cringe. Also some ellanova because.

Astrapella has some of the most sublime dynamics in the entirety of the Chronicles. The two of them have radically different value systems (see: Wind vs Ice), but they both manage to find similar expression in their passions for academics and magitech. So they have to work together, and hash out an understanding between their conflicting worldviews. And it turns out that they develop this sort of complicated understanding of each of their domains, of the other's triggers and trouble spots, and it just works. They're like two jigsaw puzzle pieces that don't seem to fit together at first, but when you turn them the right way, you see that they do fit together after all.

And because no one likes femslash, this dynamic has gone totally unexplored.

Help my grandmother stay alive!

Hey everyone, my abuela in Mexico has just been diagnosed with a brain tumor. There's a surgical procedure that could save her life, but they only do that procedure in a few hospitals in America, and none in Mexico. The problem is, it's going to cost us tens of thousands of dollars. I don't know if we can ever afford that.

Can anyone help us out?

I'm really sorry to say that this is another angsty one, taking place after the Battle of Ephesus...

This is someone dying while having an MRI scan. Before you die, your brain releases tons and tons of endorphins that make you feel a range of emotions. Tragically beautiful.

Predictions for End of the Shadow Nebula, go

[b]@komm-susser-todd[/b]:

Ariel's actions will make everyone in the empire dissolve into gray goop and then merge into a collective hivemind.

[b]@anillusivewoman[/b]:

The book is gonna have multiple endings and you'll pick from one of them, like a choose-your-adventure book. But all of these endings have Gali dying in self-sacrifice somehow and/or the entire nebula getting destroyed.

[b]@blick-winkel[/b]:

The reader is a character in the story all along. And you're changing the story by reading it. Like the Heisenberg effect or something like that (GTM's gonna come up with something). The only way the characters will get a good ending is if you stop reading.

[b]@tjlc-johnlocked[/b]:

Gali will turn out to have a secret evil twin sister who's been manipulating all of the events of the series from the very start. And the entirety of books 4 and 5 will be in Gali's mind.

[b]@puellainsomnio[/b]:

Gali will literally become the new God of the nebula.

[Fanart of Astra and Capella overlaid with the lyrics to Cosmic Love by Florence and the Machine. The images are animated gifs. The first two frames are side-profile portraits of Astra and Capella over backgrounds of meteor showers. Astra is facing left and Capella is facing right. Their eyes contain reflections of the stars and meteor showers.]

[The next two frames show stars fading, as during the use of the Blackout Spell during the Battle of Ephesus in Book 3, Part 2: War Between Heaven and Earth. The stars and moons are blinking out of existence.]

[There are frames for every line in the lyrics, showing mostly Astrapella but also some of the other characters, with hints of Brunova.]

if i haven't posted anything for a while, it's because i've been working on this for a really, really long time. i'm glad to finally release it to the world...

Does anyone else think that Gali's character arc in Book 4 is a metaphor for the Obama presidency? Think about it: the heir to the empire sacrifices the Administrator (academia) and betrays Astra (social programs) in order to suck up to the fascist dictator Ariel (the GOP), who feels an irrational loyalty to the Demiurge (Reagan), a figure whom Ariel does not truly know or understand.

Gali then goes on to confront Tycho (the increasingly dispossessed and disillusioned middle class) and Bruno (Bruno), and is increasingly becoming distant from the Creator (true leftism), who nevertheless has an unreasonable amount of trust in him despite his failures at enacting the Creator's goals.

It just makes too much sense.

Help my grandmother stay alive!

Hey everyone, my abuela in Mexico has just been diagnosed with a brain tumor. There's a surgical procedure that could save her life, but they only do that procedure in a few hospitals in America, and none in Mexico. The problem is, it's going to cost us tens of thousands of dollars. I don't know if we can ever afford that.

Can anyone help us out?

Thank you so much!

Anonymous asked: still, you're really capellanebula!!! i loved all your capella-centric fics!!! no one ever did ellanova from capella's pov like you... also it must be super annoying to get asked this but are you ever gonna finish the ww2 ellanova AU??!

Yeah, I still get emails every time someone comments (it went from every day to once a week to like once a month now). If I'm feeling bad, it's one of the things that always makes me feel a little better. Even if they're stories written by a "me" that no longer exists, even if I don't really do ellanova anymore, they're still a part of what made me the person I am. Capella meant a ton to me as an adopted foreign kid growing up in the middle of nowhere; I really identified a lot with her.

Don't worry about asking anything (I don't get a lot of asks here anyway). As for that series, the only way I imagine I'll continue is if Gali somehow transitions lol. But it's never going to happen. I've moved on. That story is not something on my mind anymore.

Unfortunately yeah. I'm not trying to hide it, but I try not to advertise it either. I've changed a lot from when I was 15, and not necessarily in the obvious ways.

Okay I liked the trans girl gali headcanon so much I wrote a fic about it. It's the first time I've written fic in a while so uh. it might be cringe. Also some ellanova because.

@shadow-protectrix: listen the wildest thing happened to me today. I was at the library and I saw someone reading fanfiction on the computer. And they were reading one of mine!

@nebulascribbler: OMG that is wild!!! 😂😂😂

@nebulascribbler: I literally cannot imagine someone reading my fics in the wild

@nonbinarycatmom: wow 🤣

@nebulascribbler: Also this is random but could I get a beta for my next brunova fic? I haven't written them in a while and I don't know if I'm getting them right. Thanks!

@auguroflight: I'll look at it.

@nonbinarycatmom: yeah i can read it!

@nebulascribbler: Thank you! I'll dm the link.

...

@brunova-official: hey sorry for barging in, but could you guys boost my donation post?

@nebulascribbler: Yes, of course!.

@shadow-protectrix: I am so sorry that this is happening to you, Lux. Is there anything else we could do to help?

@brunova-official: the only thing that'll help is money

@brunova-official: so just reblog the post i guess

@shadow-protectrix: Already done. I wish I could do more to help 🙁

@lunan0va: the concept of a multiverse is super cool!

@lunan0va: so like... multiverses exist so anything is possible... anything that can exist is existing somewhere? so there's a universe where i'm a cis girl? and there's a universe where the chronicles is literally real? 

@trappedinspace: There's actually a philosophy paper kind of about this. Check out Possible Girls by Neil Sinhababu. Actually don't check it out because it sucks but, uh, it exists.

[b]Universe - Canon[/b]

[b]Excerpt from [i]Chronicles of the Shadow Nebula, Book 4: The Complete Collection[/i], Afterword, by G. T. Macmillan[/b]

The Chronicles of the Shadow Nebula is not a story of heroism or hope. From the very beginning, it never was. It is a story of war and death and betrayal. It is a story of suffering and inevitability and the immutability of the laws of the universe. But more than that, it is a story of failure. Our society fails to teach young people about the inevitability and necessity of failure, and thus I have made it central to the Chronicles.

I believe that children must learn about failure, because life is inevitably a sequence of failures. They must learn what it means to live in a world that does not cater to their whims and expectations. They must learn that almost nothing will go the way of their dreams.

When you fall, will you learn how to pick yourself up again? Or will you keep on waiting for a savior, some miracle that sets you right?

Aaaaaaand the asks are rolling in!

[Screenshot of an ask: Anonymous asked: I'm sorry for what she said about you. That was totally out of line.]

Thanks.

Anonymous asked: hey gtm fucked up here you were right 

Anonymous asked: gtm is literally picking fights with a 16 year old what the fuck is wrong with that.

Anonymous asked: hey don't let the transphobes get you down! You're an amazing person!

Thanks to all of you...

Anonymous asked: Macmillan was right. You'll never be a real woman.

Anonymous asked: why do you hate women lol

Anonymous asked: I'm glad gtm finally spoke up about people like you. You're the toxic presence making this site worse.

And we have these. Like, do you think you can do worse than my parents? Do you think I've never heard stuff like this?

Anonymous asked: when you die scientists will know that you're a male by the ridges on your skull :)

Okay nvm that's a new one. Good thing my people do cremations!

Anonymous asked: lol "gali is a trans girl" how delusional can you get. Are you brain damaged. Oh wait you are 'cause you're a tranny.

Did you even read my post.

Okay I should really. Go do homework or something. But god I can't stop thinking about this stuff.

No I'm not fine actually. This was transphobic as fuck right? Like the whole point of that article is that I'm "erasing women" somehow? By being trans? That I'm taking away rights for women? That's pretty fucked up.

Okay I got called a mentally ill (derogatory) degenerate (got the first part right) and gtm went full mask off on transphobia. Is that right? Am I hallucinating?

Honestly I'm still kinda in shock. This can't be happening.

Hey, did you hear what gtm just said? She said that according to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care...

Help my grandmother stay alive!

Hey everyone, my abuela in Mexico has just been diagnosed with a brain tumor. There's a surgical procedure that could save her life, but they only do that procedure in a few hospitals in America, and none in Mexico. The problem is, it's going to cost us tens of thousands of dollars. I don't know if we can ever afford that.

Can anyone help us out?

[Picture of a child Lux with his grandmother]

Thank you so much!

[b]@brunova-official:[/b]

As a reminder i'm open to fic/art commissions to pay for my abuela's cancer treatment! We can negotiate rates! For examples of my art, see below! No nsf/w or gore, and I can't do furry or detailed machinery.

[This is a multi-panel comic of Bruno and Gali. "Do you know happened when the universe was born?" Gali asks. "The Binary Bible tells us that the Creator created the universe out of a need  for love, but that isn't true. The Demiurge and the Creator were born from the same origin, and the creation of our world was nothing more than an accident. What if the books that we were all taught weren't the words of Abraxas at all, but edited by the emperor in order to instill conformity?"]

[There is a panel without dialogue, just Bruno staring at Gali. Bruno responds, "Do you know what will happen when the universe dies?"]

[In the next panel, Bruno kisses Gali on the lips.]

["This is what happens when the universe ends," says Bruno.]

Because for some cursed reason I *still* see newly out guys do it: DO NOT BIND WITH ACE BANDAGES!!! It can literally break your ribs and do permanent damage to your lungs. Also don't wear your binder while sleeping, don't wear it for longer than 10 hours.

Hey y'all, NebulaCon is coming in no more than three weeks!!! Since it's coincidental with the premier of the Book 4 Part 1 movie, as a lot of people have requested, we will be hosting a screening of the premier, with a new guest, Nathan Emory, who you probably better know as Eridanus Sputnik from Book 2!!!

I have read the entirety of GTM's latest post. No, your eyes aren't lying to you, this is transphobic, and in fact it is disturbing how rife it is with the latest in transphobic rhetoric. I'll deconstruct some of it below the cut.

Anonymous asked: what do you think of the theory that Astra has fallen in love with Emperor Ariel? And that they'll end up together somehow?

[i]Deep sigh[/i] I hoped I wouldn't get asked this. Listen, people, Stockholm syndrome is not a good foundation for romance to blossom! Not to mention that Astra viscerally despises Ariel; she isn't a hateful person by any means, so it means a lot that she actually dislikes someone. And contrary to popular belief, disliking someone is not a sign that you're secretly in love with them.

[b]@astrastellar:[/b]

You know what? No. Fuck this. Fuck you. This is internalized misogyny. People loooove ships like br*unova that are abusive as fuck as long as it's all about the men. But once you actually have a ship where the woman thinks for herself and rejects the confines of polite society, it's "Stockholm syndrome"? Puritans like you don't have any tolerance for moral complexity. You just want your stories to tell you how you should feel. You don't have the deep reading skills necessary to read between the lines to see what's actually going on. Not to mention you only give this treatment to the ships that are popular with women.

[b]@theweaveroflight:[/b]

Okay, what the fuck are you talking about? Brunova and ariastra aren't anything alike! For one, neither Bruno nor Gali is a several-hundred-year-old man who is the emperor and also a mass murderer. Neither of them have tried to kill or torture the other, as far as we know. And just fyi, literally every ship here is "popular with women" so that argument doesn't fly.

[b]@monadcore:[/b]

Can we absolutely not do this? Please???

[b]@nebulascribbler:[/b]

Yeah, everyone's entitled to their opinions but please try to be a bit less over-the-top.

Hey everyone! You might remember me as the artist and animator who first created the sample for "Half Full, Half Empty." That one piece got a better reception than anything I've ever done before. Well guess what: we're turning this into an actual cartoon! I'm working with @ahistoricallyqueer who created the concept as the writer, along with @itsbrittany and @aceagentcarter as artists!

[link to fundraising website]

We need $16000 total to make 6 20-minute episodes. Most of that money will be going to salaries, so that we can pay rent and eat while we work on this and not have take extra part-time jobs.

Thank you all so much!!!!!

[image of a close-up on a pale-skinned person's purple eye]

"Alexandria's Genesis, a.k.a violet eyes (a genetic mutation).

When someone is born with Alexandria's Genesis, their eyes are blue or gray at birth. After six months, the eyes begin to change from their original color to purple, and this process lasts six months. During puberty, the color deepens to dark purple, a deep purple, a royal purple, or a violet-blue color and remains that way. It does not affect the person's eyesight.

Those who have this mutation will never grow any facial, body, pubic, or anal hair (not including hair on their head, on their ears, noses, eyebrows and eyelashes). Women also do not menstruate, but are fertile"

A number of individuals have asked me about a post on this website. Normally the discourse and discussions circulating on this website are none of my concern, but this time, I feel an obligation to respond.

A post has recently been brought to my attention that describes Gali Nova as a "transwoman". First of all, the theory that he was somehow intended to be a transwoman is preposterous. I think any rational individual can see that. However, the presence of posts such as these indicates a deeper layer of pathological thinking among some of the young people on this site. It is exemplary of a certain postmodern, degenerated conception of "gender" that has gained a horrifying foothold among the populace on this website, and young people at large. Without exaggeration, this ideology will, if left unchecked, lead to the destruction of all that feminism has achieved over the past century.

@trappedinspace: Hey @lunan0va, I just saw your blog. I'm really sorry about what's happening. Are you doing okay?

@apocalypse-hoarder: This shit sucks so much, huh.

@lunan0va: yeah i'm fine lol

@trappedinspace: If the comments are getting bad, you might want to turn off anon or turn off all asks and comments. 

@lunan0va: don't worry, i'm not getting any more of the nasty asks. and it doesn't really bother me that much anyway. or at least, i'm trying to not be bothered by it.

@trappedinspace: Are you sure it's okay? Feel free to just go offline and take a break from this website if the harassment is getting serious.

@lunan0va: lmao i don't have any other places to go. like, the messages are literally just shit my parents say and all the people in my church say. they can't hurt me more than irl already has lmao.

@trappedinspace: I'm so sorry 💜

@trappedinspace: If there's anything I can do to help, or if you just need to talk... 

@lunan0va: it's fine 💙️

        @lunan0va: wait this is totally random but what's your element @trappedinspace?

        @trappedinspace: Oh god... it's metal, I guess? Last I checked I was a weaver of metal, even though I identified a lot more with Capella than Astra.

        @lunan0va: haha that makes sense.

        @trappedinspace: why? Is it just because I'm a nerd?

        @lunan0va: well you are a nerd, but it's more the vibes i guess?

        @trappedinspace: what vibes?

        @lunan0va: the fact that you're asking about your vibes is a huge metal vibe :p

        @lunan0va: anyway uh... i'm heading out. i actually have to do homework now.

        @trappedinspace: Take care.
