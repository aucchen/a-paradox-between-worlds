[b]Excerpt from Chronicles of the Shadow Nebula, Book 3, Part 2: War Between Heaven and Earth by G. T. Macmillan[/b]

"In this book lies knowledge. In knowledge lies truth. In this book lies knowledge. In knowledge lies truth. In this book lies knowledge. In knowledge lies truth..."

"Capella? What are you doing?" Gali noticed the girl pacing about the empty classroom, a copy of the Binary Bible clung near her chest, muttering under her breath.

"Somewhere in this book, there's truth. There's got to be."

"What do you mean?"

"Why this is all happening. Why we're at war. Why does the Emperor want to kill us."

"What if there isn't a reason?" asked Gali, almost rhetorically.

"Everything has a cause. Some motive force. Unless our entire theory of magic is a lie..."

*page_break "Is there such a thing as truth?"

"Is there such a thing as truth?" asked Capella rhetorically, as if speaking to an empty room. "Is there truth in the Binary Bible? Is there truth in our magic? Can our magic really bring us closer to divinity?"

The wind around her swirled, picking up scattered pages. It was like a whirlwind surrounding her. When Gali failed to speak, she continued rambling.

"What are the Creator and the Demiurge? Are they one or two? Are they really distinct? Is one good and the other evil or are they aspects of the same? And what are [i]we[/i]? Are we fragments of creation? Or are we just the puppets of the Cosmos who play-act our predestined parts for their entertainment?"

*page_break Gali didn't know what to say.

Gali didn't know what to say. Was he supposed to comfort the girl, to tell her that everything would be fine one day? That would be lying.

Then, suddenly, the door of the classroom opened again, and in strode Astra.

"What are you two doing here?" she asked.

"Are we just puppets of the Aeons?" ejaculated Capella, suddenly glaring daggers at the other girl.

"What? Why would we be?" asked Astra, befuddled.

"The deities, the Creator, the Demiurge, all of them, they never cared about us. They just... see us as toys. Playthings to use for their enjoyment."

*page_break Astra sighed.

Astra sighed, and strolled to the agitated girl. She held her arms out, and enveloped the other girl within her gentle hold.

"I'm here. I'm with you. You'll be fine."

"I... won't be..."

Capella was sobbing. The tension in her muscles dissipated, leaving her entire weight supported by Astra's body.

"We'll all be fine," said Astra. "The Cosmos doesn't matter right now. Only you do."

[b]@icemoongirl reblogged from @icemoongirl at 7:00 PM. OP: @icemoongirl[/b]

Hey. It's Luna. I haven't posted in a while, but I just wanted to say that I'm doing alright. Well, for certain definitions of alright.

I moved back with my parents last week. They acted as if nothing had changed. They didn't yell at me; neither did they do the stereotypical tearful reunion, saying they love me and whatnot. It'd honestly be a little creepy if they did. I think my siblings talked with them, convinced them to at the very least not murder me. For that, I'm thankful more than anything else.

I ended up only missing a few days of school. It wasn't a big deal. I just took my AP tests. They were... Not good but at least over with. I'm looking at colleges out of state, cheap places or where I could get a scholarship that doesn't depend on my family.

So basically, it's back to the status quo ante bellum in this household. Which is fine; it's what I had planned on all along. I'm a patient person. I can outlast them; I'm good at waiting and suffering in silence and pretending I don't exist IRL. After all, I'm an Augur of Ice.

God, it's so strange that I still think in nebulaverse terms. That series left an indelible mark on me. Despite G*T*M's best efforts, I don't know if I would have realized my trans-ness without those books, and the community we built around them. Even the bad memories of the last month can't fully make me hate the stories. But, of course, I won't be engaging with the Nebulaverse anymore. I've orphaned all my fics at the archive. I don't know what if anything can replace it in my mind. But maybe I don't need it anymore. I hope I won't need it anymore.

Thanks to Karla, Laura, Hari, @{luna_helped Lux, and especially $!{handle}|and Lux} for helping me through this mess. You're like family to me. I love y'all.

[b]@icemoongirl:[/b]

Sometimes it feels like all our heroes are dead and our enemies are in power. G*TM got a writing award from the BBC for that essay where she called me a slur. She went on to misgender me on prime time TV, and no one corrected her. Even to my ostensible supporters and allies I'm a boy now. They think I'm a trans boy, which is immeasurably funny to me.

Things objectively aren't getting better for me. My transitioning has gone from "my parents don't want this" to "the state is literally banning this". And that doesn't even narrow down my state.

But I'm fine, because I'm alive. I know there are people who would help me, who would care for me as I really am.

My abuela is finally scheduled for the surgery. It's supposed to be in a few weeks. I don't even know what to say. I hope she stays. We have tens of thousands of dollars of loans we can't possibly repay. It's like an unending maw into which we throw our resources, our dreams, our futures...

Anyway I'm still taking commissions I guess? It doesn't help but it can't hurt...

So here's the tally of where things are:

- the actors for Gali, Astra, Tycho, and Capella have all directly called out gtm and supported trans rights. So has the Administrator.
*line_break
- the actors for Bruno, Lyra, and Yuri have made wishy-washy statements
*line_break
- the actor for Ariel is the only one who's openly supporting gtm for now
*line_break
- gtm claimed that everyone who's still buying her stuff all support her views (this is absolutely false btw, even if I disagree with people who are still buying that shit)
*line_break
- the BBC gave her a ton of airtime where she could uncritically proselytize transphobia. She also got some editorial space in a few different newspapers and a bunch of journalists defending her against "cancel culture" or whatever.
*line_break
- on the other hand, the outlets that aren't actively supporting gtm are doing this both sides thing where they're just calling it internet drama.

All in all... it could be a lot better and it could be worse. We can't really do anything but keep on going, I guess. It's gonna be a long fight.

Hey y'all. I haven't been posting since NebulaCon was canceled, and you deserve to know why. It's a long story, so [i]bear[/i] with me.

[gif of a brown bear cuddling with a man on the ground]

It didn't take long for news of you-know-what to reach Hardin County, Kentucky. Somehow it reached my husband. He knew that I was into the Chronicles, so he talked to me about it. He said that the trans people who criticized you-know-who (he didn't say "trans people") were all crazy and he was glad that you-know-who came out so hard against trans people (again, he didn't say "trans people"). I tried to disagree politely as best as I could. But somehow the argument got more heated, and it got to a point where I mentioned that I was nonbinary. I shouldn't have mentioned it.

When I told him I was nonbinary, he said that he didn't mind what I thought in my head, as long as I would continue to be a wife and a woman for him. Those words made me angry like I've never been before.

[cartoon image of a dog in a burning room saying "This is fine"]

It wasn't fine. I don't even know why that made me so angry. Maybe rationally, I shouldn't have been, because that's what I had been doing before; it was a bargain I made in my mind that I had long accepted. But it was a bargain that had never been vocalized. When finally it was spoken out loud, something changed in me. I started to understand why so many of y'all were so angry about you-know-who. I started to see why some of y'all were angry at me, even. It was like a dam within me broke.

But anyway, I said some things that hurt him. Kiddos, look away, because what's coming up is NSFW.

[gif of Bruno putting his hands over Gali's eyes]

[gif of the gang of five running away from a burning building]

[gif of Tycho looking away from something disgusting]

Okay, are the kids gone yet? Good.

I told him I never enjoyed the times we had sex.

That sent him into a rage. I said it wasn't his fault, I wouldn't enjoy sex with anyone, but when you've only had sex with one person, that raises some implications and probably made it worse. What happened next, it doesn't need to be said.

I'm not living in our house anymore. Don't worry, I have a place to stay. We're filing for divorce as I'm writing this. I'm worried about the kids, since they're staying with him for now. I'm worried what he's saying about me.

Anyway, I'm sorry about what I said before. I'm sorry about happened to @/lunan0va, and how I was complicit in her harassment. I don't know what happened to her but I really, really wish she's doing okay. I feel like I didn't understand then, but now...

Does anyone want to see my cringey character development haircut? No? Well, too bad! Here it is!

I'll probably be posting here and checking this blog a lot less, for what should be fairly obvious reasons. So I suppose this is kind of a goodbye?

Every story affects us a different way. Some stories are like salves for the soul, the kind of story I still read at night to go to bed feeling better. Others are like pinpricks to the heart, stories that hurt, stories that make me feel *something*, even if that something isn't exactly good. Nothing makes one kind of story inherently better than another. Maybe we need both kinds of stories to function.

Anyway, not all stories will feel good to read. Some stories will hurt and that's okay.

There have been a lot of messages since you were last here.

@trappedinspace: So uh I'm out of jail what did I miss

@trappedinspace: A lot I guess huh

@trappedinspace: Luna I am so sorry about what happened I really really wish I could've been there to help

@icemoongirl: lol it's fine!!!! you were in literally in jail???

@trappedinspace: Yeah.

@trappedinspace: also hi Luna. Congrats on the new url. It's great.

@icemoongirl: Wow. Thank you!!!

@icemoongirl: also say hi to lux @brunova-official and hari @noncanonical!

@brunova-official: nice to meet you guys

@noncanonical: Yeah, thanks Luna for inviting us to this chat!

@capellasgf: hello new comrades :3

        @icemoongirl: can i ask you something karla?

        @trappedinspace: sure, I guess?

        @icemoongirl: how do you do it? how do you manage to get up everyday and just... do what it takes to keep on living?

        @trappedinspace: honestly I don't know myself sometimes. It's hard.

        @trappedinspace: a lot of times I feel like there's no hope for trans women.

        @icemoongirl: do you think it'll ever get better?

        @trappedinspace: honestly idk

        @trappedinspace: last month I would have said something different. Maybe even last week.

        @trappedinspace: but now I just feel like... I'm going backwards. I'm sliding back to what I was like before. I thought I got better in the past year but it turns out I really haven't.

        @trappedinspace: Maybe it'll never get better. Maybe it's just going to be like this forever. 

        @trappedinspace: they say it's two steps forward, one step back, but how do you know that it's not one step forward, two steps back?

                @noncanonical: May I say something here?

                @icemoongirl: sure?

                @noncanonical: I'm probably old enough to be your parent. My oldest is in high school.

                @noncanonical: My partner and I have been together for 20 years. We have 4 kids, and our kids went from having two moms to having two dads. We've literally been through all the letters in LGBT. It used to be illegal for us to have a family in the way we do.

                @noncanonical: This isn't to tell you how hard we've had it. It's to tell you that things change. I could talk about the ordeals we've faced. Maybe you've faced some different things.

                @noncanonical: I know sometimes it's hard. It's been hard. I've felt hopeless too. I can't tell you that things will get better, because I don't know you, and I can never know what it's like to be you. But I can tell you that things will be different. The world will be different. And you will be different.

                @icemoongirl: wow, thanks dad.

                @noncanonical: Please don't call me that. You don't know me that well.

                        @trappedinspace: Okay I just read it. And wow this story arc feels totally unearned. They did not deserve a catharsis.

                        @noncanonical: I don't think anyone really "deserves" anything. People don't have story arcs in real life.

                        @noncanonical: And besides, you don't really know them. Seeing someone through the interwebs isn't at all like seeing them in real life.

                        @trappedinspace: I don't know...

                        @capellasgf: i read the post (claire's blocked me too lol) and i really wish it's possible to, like, move on. for all of us.

                        @icemoongirl: same here :/

                        @brunova-official: same but for bruno :/

                        @trappedinspace: I think the nebulaverse has like, buried itself within us in an inextricable place.

                                @you: i hate the nebulaverse now.

                                @icemoongirl: see logically i think i should hate it now, but i can't. i just can't bring myself to hate it.

                        @noncanonical: Maybe there are two Nebulaverses. The one created by GTM, and the one we constructed with our own art and fics and meta.

                        @noncanonical: Maybe there are infinite Nebulaverses, one for each of us. There's a Shadow Nebula inside each of our hearts, and we never have to let that part of ourselves go, even if our relationship to the "canonical" Nebulaverse changes.

                        @trappedinspace: I still think it's a good idea to move on. Every bit of fandom activity we engage in just gives gtm more exposure and more social capital. There is literally nothing we can do as fans to fight against her transphobia except stop engaging.

                        @noncanonical: Maybe you're right. But I don't think this is a fight we can win. All we can do is follow our conscience. I'm still not going to engage with the Nebulaverse, btw.

        @shadow-protectrix: I can't exactly show my face in the fandom right now, given what happened with NebulaCon.

        @shadow-protectrix: Besides that extremely large caveat... I'm still writing, even if I'm not posting my stories on the archive. Writing was and kind of still is my reason to live. The Nebulaverse was just where I ended up. 

        @shadow-protectrix: I think from now on I'll write my own stories, outside of the confines of the nebulaverse. That would be nice, wouldn't it?

                        @icemoongirl: not that my life has been going swimmingly lately, but it is what it is -_-

                        @icemoongirl: maybe it'd feel better to talk about it more, i guess?

                        @you: yeah, sometimes it's nice to just talk.

                        @icemoongirl: thank you again for everything 💙️

                        @you: i'm sure there's something out there! if not, maybe we'll make our own universe...

@you: um... hi karla

@you: sorry if this is totally random but how's the investigation of stella/sofia?

@trappedinspace: wow. I totally forgot. For what I hope are fairly obvious reasons lol.

@trappedinspace: Okay, I just checked Stella's account and it's rather interesting.

@trappedinspace: It looks like Stella deleted. And looking at the archives, they were clearly involved in another attempt to call out Claire, which has apparently died out. The notes for the Claire plagiarism callout are a graveyard of deleted users.

@trappedinspace: Obviously this is suspicious but like, there's really no point anymore. They're all the virtual equivalent of corpses now.

@trappedinspace: Did you find out anything new?

        @trappedinspace: Oh wow. This is incredible. She just... confessed to it.

        @trappedinspace: Also what the fuck is wrong with Sofia.

        @trappedinspace: Now I see that she's apparently taking a hiatus. How convenient.

        @trappedinspace: Maybe we should make a callout post lmao.

        @trappedinspace: Even if Sofia is already gone. It could be like, a historical artifact.

                @trappedinspace: Good idea. I'll write something up.

                @trappedinspace: I wonder if this chat screenshot alone is enough evidence... but tbh I don't see how we can get more.
