[b]Excerpt from Chronicles of the Shadow Nebula, Book 3, Part 1: Peace Between Heaven and Earth by G. T. Macmillan[/b]

The planet of Samaria was supposed to have been undefended. They were supposed to have been greeted as liberators. It was supposed to be a combination training and humanitarian mission.

Gali could not forget what he saw. The rebel troopers with their pellet guns were no match for Imperial Magi, even magi-in-training. He remembered the glee with which Bruno had hollowed out their bodies, his spells turning their forms to shriveled up husks. He remembered the rebel emerging from the house, no older than a boy, shouldering a gun, frightened expression on his unmasked face, the bullets deflected by Gali's energy shield, his stiff body when the lightning had struck him. But Gali couldn't remember casting the spell.

The Administrator strode forth. Gali confronted him.

*page_break "Why did you lie to us?"

"Why did you lie to us?" asked Gali. "You told us this would be a training mission."

"We had faulty intelligence," the Administrator answered, and Gali could almost believe him. But then the man sighed.

"I needed to show you something. Show all of you." The Administrator continued. "I needed to show you the costs of the Empire's rule. See this? This is what the Emperor has decreed. This is how it always ends."

Gali didn't understand what the man was saying. "What do you mean?" he asked in an accusing voice.

"I mean that..." The Administrator took a long pause, stroking his beard and gazing about the ruins. "I mean that this will never stop. It will only worsen."

*page_break "Traitor."

"Traitor." Bruno suddenly materialized, as if out of nowhere. "I know your game. You're a traitor to the Empire, that's what you are." The blond boy tossed a chunk of ice from one hand to the other, all the while glaring at the Administrator.

The administrator only smiled, returning Bruno's gaze. Bruno's hand flicked. A blue bolt shot forth, only to be met with a red beam from the Administrator's fingers. The magical projectiles collided, exploding in midair, the resulting fireball scorching the grass.

"I could have you executed, Mr. Helios," said the Administrator, not breaking his smile.

"You would kill the scion of the Helios family?" Bruno smirked. "I could end you right now if I expose your plots."

"The nebula is more complicated than you believe, my child. Come. I'll show you." The Administrator beckoned to the two boys.

*page_break Gali followed...

Gail followed the Administrator. Bruno walked in tow, arms folded across his chest. It was not a long walk to the field headquarters, situated in a green tent. Inside, Astra, Capella, and Tycho were already waiting.

"A storm is afoot," said the Administrator in a dark voice. "Forces beyond our mortal comprehension are gathering, and I fear we may be powerless to stop them."

Surprisingly, it was Tycho who stepped in. "So what do you expect us to do? Lay down and die? Let the Demiurge claim us?"

"No," said the Administrator. He paced about his cramped headquarters, stroking his beard. "You do not understand. Perhaps you will never understand."

"So tell us what going on! So at least we can try!" shouted Capella, who had previously been standing on the sidelines.

The Administrator sighed. "Fine, if you so desire."

*page_break Gali watched...

Gail watched intently as the Administrator activated the holographic display on his table. A blue hologram projected upward, showing a map of the Empire's myriad worlds.

The Administrator pointed at the Capitol world of Antioch.

"We are at war with ourselves," he proclaimed. "A shadow movement is brewing against the Emperor, gathering more adherents daily. The Emperor has gone mad in trying to root it out. He has turned our armies against entire worlds. We see not just Samaria, but also Cappadocia, Ephesus, and countless other worlds all burning. This is the world you will enter. This is the lord you will serve."

He takes a deep breath. "And the man leading the shadow movement... is standing before you."

What remains are only ruins, and the hardy survivors who fight within them.

So I've been thinking a lot about death lately.

It wouldn't be the first time I tried. The first time, I just started chewing asprin pills for some reason lol. Barely had a stomachache.

Don't worry, I'm not going to do it.

But there's this bridge I walk across almost every day. It's over a 12-lane highway. And every time I cross it, I look down. I imagine how I would jump down, how I would vault over the railings which are far too low. I imagine what it would be like. Would it be the fall? No, it's too short. Or would it be one of the 18-wheelers? And I remember Leelah Alcorn and I just freeze, and I realize that I don't want to be like her. I don't want to die.

I want to live, but I have no idea how.

It's not so much that I enjoy living. It's more that, well, I'm afraid of what comes next. I don't know if I'm still a Christian but I'm definitely going to hell. And even if not, I'm just going to stop existing, and that might be even scarier. I think we're all afraid of not existing. And, this is ridiculous, but I'm afraid of what would happen to my memory afterwards. There wouldn't be any trace of me left. There wouldn't be any evidence left in the world that I was a woman. That I existed as a trans girl in this world. I don't want to die before I ever existed.

I had an argument with my dad. It wasn't even an argument about me. I didn't try to come out or anything like that (I have some sense of self-preservation after all). It was just a political argument about whether or not trans girls are predators for using women's restrooms. And I just, I just remembered all the messages they sent me, and my dad was basically saying the exact same things that the anons were saying. And I couldn't deal with it anymore, so I got angry, really angry, and yelled at him and said some shitty things and he told me to leave and so I did...

So I'm here in the library. On the library's computer. They're closing in a few hours. I don't know what to do.

I'm scared of a lot of things right now. Like what I'm going to eat. Where I'm going to live. If I have to sleep on the streets in the next two hours.

Have you ever wondered how you ended up with the friends you have? There was one mutual I whom I followed on here because I saw their tags on a post and thought they were funny. We became roommates a few years later. Another of my best friends I met while waiting in line at the grocery store. My current partner sat next to me in a class in college. That class was a last minute registration after the classes I wanted to get into were full.

What I'm saying is, basically everything good in life happens by accident. I'm not sure if there's even a lesson here. Maybe you don't have to always be trying to do the best thing all the time or whatever. Maybe it's okay to just live.

thanks everyone. but I don't know if you should even donate anymore. it's a fucking black hole.

Help my grandmother stay alive!

Hey everyone, my abuela in Mexico has just been diagnosed with a brain tumor. There's a surgical procedure that could save her life, but they only do that procedure in a few hospitals in America, and none in Mexico. The problem is, it's going to cost us tens of thousands of dollars. I don't know if we can ever afford that.

Can anyone help us out?

Thank you so much!

As a reminder i'm open to fic/art commissions to pay for my abuela's cancer treatment! We can negotiate rates! For examples of my art, see below! No nsf/w or gore, and I can't do furry or detailed machinery.

Also here's my fanfics: [link to archive]

Donations have slowed recently, but we're not nearly achieving our goals. I still have three slots open for art/fic commissions, nebulaverse or otherwise!!

I hate the people who are like, oh no, gtm is suddenly transphobic, what are we gonna do. Because the hints were there in the books from the start. Not even subtle hints. Does literally no one remember the kingdomite device subplot? Or were we too busy trying to "reclaim" it by refusing to see what was right in front of our eyes?

A notice: as of today, we will no longer be updating this blog. Many of us running this blog are trans, and the author's comments and behaviors have led to a hostile environment towards trans members of the fandom. After a discussion with the mods, we have come to the understanding that we can no longer participate in Nebulaverse fandom in good conscience. 

[b]@shadow-protectrix:[/b]

Guys, come on. Do you really think a boycott would work? Is this the best use of our time and effort as a fandom?

Not that anyone's gonna care but here's a brunova oneshot. Call it vent fic if you must. The title is obviously from a lyric, but everything else is mine. Entirely mine. Take everything I have from me but you will never take away my words.

You want a response? You want a response to what people have been saying about me? Well, here it is.

1. Fuck you
*line_break
2. It's literally all bullshit. I haven't even read the books they said I copied from. Or the fics they said I copied from. Ask me what they were about. I literally couldn't tell you. I've talked about some of the books and fics I've read on here. Come on, do you really think I copied my stories from Tom fucking Clancy? Contrary to popular belief I'm not actually a boomer.
*line_break
3. Fuck you again.

As you might have realized, NebulaCon will be canceled. Too many participants have dropped out, too many reservations canceled, so it will no longer be possible for us to provide everyone with the experiences that they deserve. I'm sorry for anyone who was still looking forward to it.

Anonymous asked: what do you make of the latest plagiarism allegations against @shadow-protectrix?

A bunch of people have asked me about this. I mean, the accusations are pretty weak. I looked at the passages and they seemed like sentences anyone could write. I found similar sentences in a lot of other stories and I don't think they're all plagiarists. This isn't to say that these are particularly good sentences, but that's kind of the point.

Regarding Claire's "plagiarism" allegations: the evidence just isn't there! There are obviously a ton of people who have it out for Claire for various reasons but this latest accusation feels like at best a reach, at worst just deliberate provocation, just throwing scattershot accusations against them in the hopes that something sticks.

I *know* that the nebulaverse movies have canon appearances for the characters. I know this and I choose to ignore it. For one thing, Capella isn't the only poc in the whole cast.

Also, Gali is a trans boy.

Yes, and that's what Claire would say regardless of the veracity of the call out. So it tells us nothing we didn't already know. And we already know that Claire has been deceptive on occasion so come to your own conclusions.

This is a compilation post of the evidence that Claire @shadow-protectrix has plagiarized their fics. There is substantial evidence that portions of Mars, Bringer of War are lifted wholesale from various novels as well as a number of prior works of fanfiction.

For example, see the below passage from MBoW chapter 4:

I hate the people who are like, oh no, gtm is suddenly transphobic, what are we gonna do. Because the hints were there in the books from the start. Not even subtle hints. Does literally no one remember the kingdomite device subplot? Or were we too busy trying to "reclaim" it by refusing to see what was right in front of our eyes?

@nebulascribbler: Hey Claire...

@shadow-protectrix: Don't you fuckin ask me about NebulaCon.

@nebulascribbler: I don't think it has to be cancelled. I think we can still bring it back.

@shadow-protectrix: Yes, I'm swearing now because it's gotten that bad.

@shadow-protectrix: I AM NOT GIVING YOU NEBULACON. YOU CAN TAKE ITS ROTTEN CORPSE FROM MINE.

@nebulascribbler: ...I'm not asking for it.

@shadow-protectrix: FUCK NO YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE THE SPOKESPERSON FOR NEBULACON

@nebulascribbler: All I'm asking is for a different public face to it. You can still do whatever you want

@nonbinarycatmom: um friendos? did I miss something???

@shadow-protectrix: SOFIA NEBULASCRIBBLER IS A MANIPULATIVE SORCERESS WHO ATTEMPTED TO STEAL NEBULACON FROM ME

@brunova-official: what

@nebulascribbler: ...a sorceress. Not as cool as a mage, but I can live with that :)

                @nebulascribbler: It's been obvious for a while, hasn't it?

                @nebulascribbler: Would you be at all surprised if I told you yes?

                @nebulascribbler: It's so easy to create alternate identities on this website. How do you know your other supposed friends are who they say they are?

                @nebulascribbler: It was a social experiment, I suppose.

                @nebulascribbler: It wasn't entirely a success because I don't think most people bought the plagiarism allegations. But a lot did.
            #Cool. Good job.
                @you: cool. good job.

                @nebulascribbler: I'll be honest, that's not the response I expected.

                @nebulascribbler: I like that.

        @nebulascribbler: Once you realize how the world works, it becomes a much more fluid place. A place of possibilities and even of magic. Everything seems like magic to those who don't know how to wield the power.

        @nebulascribbler: You start to see the world as a system. It's like having the shipficator: you see the lines connecting people, the numbers and patterns, the stage magic behind everything.

        @nebulascribbler: As they say, knowledge is power, and what good is power if it is left unused? If you can see the knobs and buttons that govern the world, won't you want to touch them, to fiddle with the dials and see what breaks?

        @nebulascribbler: Don't you just want to fuck shit up sometimes?

        @nebulascribbler: You see what I did just now?

                @nebulascribbler: Your loyalty is severely misplaced. This is not my world. Nor is it yours.

                @nebulascribbler: Do whatever you wish. I ultimately don't care. I will not be affected either way, as I have a different life out there in meatspace.
