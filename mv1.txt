[i]Stories can bridge the gap between who we are and who we aren't yet. Narratives allow us to exist not just here and now and in this flesh but in that possibility space as well; it's the spell that can change us. You can't change if you don't know the magic; how can't exist if you don't know how. You can feel the need in your gut so strongly it hurts every minute of your life, but all you know is the absence until the story shows you the way. When the possibility is named, when the story is told, it becomes possible for it to one day be real.[/i]

[b]Excerpt from [i]Chronicles of the Shadow Nebula, Book 1: The Academy of Magi[/i] by G. T. Macmillan[/b]

"The principal purpose of a mage is to impose his vision upon the world."

The Administrator's voice reverberated through the cavernous halls of the Academy Plaza. Metallic tables were arranged in neat rows, packed with 16 year old students sitting in uncomfortable chairs. Most were at least pretending to listen to the Administrator's speech.

It was Galileo Nova's first night at the Pulsar Academy, and he was nowhere near ready for what would come.

"This is all so trite," the blonde-haired boy next to him remarked. "They're nothing but platitudes. I'd much rather start learning our elements."

"Be quiet!" the girl with glasses whispered. "We need to listen! This is important for our future!"

The boy just laid his head on his arms. Galileo started to doze off as well; the speech truly was boring.

*page_break "A mage will have absolute freedom, and out of it create absolute order."

"A mage will have absolute freedom, and out of it create absolute order. With his command of the elements, the mage must protect the order that is at the heart of our Empire. That is all."

A round of applause. The centers of the tables opened up, and platters of food and utensils rose.

"Astra, did you really listen to all that?" the blonde boy asked.

The girl, Astra, sighed. "Yes, Bruno. We have to understand the reasons why we're here."

Another girl, this one with raven black hair, interjected. "Those were all lies. Propaganda promulgated by the powers-that-be to lull us into complacency. It's all such a horrid worldview." Meanwhile, Astra visibly rolled her eyes.

"What about you?" Bruno turned to Galileo, who must have looked confused. "What do you think?"

"Slow down! We haven't asked his name yet!" the raven-haired girl ejaculated. "I'm Capella, by the way."

*page_break "I'm Galileo Nova. Or Gali for short."

"I'm Galileo Nova. Or Gali for short."

"Gali?" Bruno said quizzically. "Why not Leo? That makes more sense."

Gali shrugged. "I don't know. It's always been that way."

"And why were you sent here?" Capella asked.

"Um, because I passed the entrance exam?" he replied.

Astra smiled. "That's why we're all here, isn't it?"

*page_break The Administrator's voice boomed again.

The Administrator's voice boomed again.

"And one more thing! Finally, you must realize that all your actions have consequences. You are but one small piece embedded in the fabric of the cosmos, connected to every other living being, and every move you make, every action you take, no matter how small, reverberates throughout the universe. From where you sit today to the words you speak, you have just set the foundation for your five years at our Academy. So take care, and be deliberate in what you do, and understand that you are not each a world unto yourself."

Another roaring round of applause.

"Well that was unnecessary," Bruno said, turning to his food again.

"So we'll all be best friends, correct?" Astra asked the table. Capella simply shrugged. Gali glanced among the others.

"Yeah. We'll be friends."

[b]Excerpt from "Another Light", WIP by Luna @lunan0va[/b]

The planet of New Antioch was in sight, its blue oceans and red continents visible to the naked eye. But there was no beauty contained within the atmosphere. It was a warzone, fought over for centuries as it bounced back and forth between Empire and Kingdom control. As they approached the surface, the scars grew ever more visible, remnants of magical storms and atomic fires that left the planet nearly devoid of all but the hardiest life.

Gali, Astra, and Capella approached the planet in their battlepods, hulls still scorched from the previous battles. They knew that the transfigurator was here. The object of their long mission would finally be reached.

"Are you okay, Gali?" asked Astra. "You haven't spoken this whole time."

"Y-yeah," she replied. "I'm okay." But the secret weighed heavily on her mind. No one knew that Gali wasn't a boy anymore, but they would find out soon enough.

*fake_choice
    #They fought their way down to the surface...
    #They negotiated with the Kingdomites for passage...
    #They used stealth to avoid the Kingdomites...

[note: insert detailed scene here - luna. sorry i haven't written this part yet!]

"So, here we are. You wanted to see this, right?" Astra gestured to the device in front of them.

The rules of the transfigurator were simple: once you had the power source, and they did, you just had to think about what you would like to change, and the machine would change you. No more, no less.

Gali opened the chamber door and sat in the chair therein. She had thought for so long about this. She had gone on a long journey with her friends to extract the substance that would power the device, without telling them of her intentions. But they wouldn't mind, would they? If they cared about her, they definitely wouldn't mind.

The power source was inserted. She pressed the trigger. 

She emerged...

*fake_choice
  #...the same, somehow.
  #...an entirely new person.
  #...different on the outside, but still the same person on the inside.

What is the "true nature" of a person, anyhow, Gali wondered. Was there some essence that made her, her? Were there alternate versions of her?

No matter. She existed, right then and there.

The Nebulaverse is a vast and... nebulous place. Well, not exactly; it's actually quite well specified, with ample worldbuilding. It started with a series of young adult novels by author G. T. Macmillan, but it's taken a life of its own. The series was adapted into movies, which have become a cultural phenomenon even among people who haven't read the books.

[A/N: For more information on the Nebulaverse, see the Stats page.]

Perhaps more important is your alignment within the Nebulaverse. Many of those in the Nebulaverse fandom classify themselves along Elements and Roles. There are five elements, which are both the five fundamental elements of the Nebulaverse as well as alignments associated with each person. A mage's element, called a persona, relates to their powers as well as their personality.

This is kind of a big deal in some circles.

[b]Excerpt from Chronicles of the Shadow Nebula, Book 1: The Academy of Magi by G. T. Macmillan[/b]

The camera stared into Galileo's exhausted eyes.

"What are you?" it asked, its voice mechanical and monotone.

"What do you mean?" the boy replied.

"What is the nature of your soul?"

Galileo glanced around the room. It was no larger than a closet, the walls barren, the floor unadorned, save the chair he sat in and the robotic camera protruding from a wall. It was only slightly terrifying.

The robot continued speaking. "Why do you exist? What is the inalienable, unchangeable core that makes you, you?"

*page_break "I, I haven't got a clue."

"I, I haven't got a clue," the boy replied.

"Hmm." The robotic voice became louder, more ominous. "None of you do. Not yet. But I already see the hue of your spark. Yes! It's there. Tell me, Gali, why aren't you more afraid of me? You know not every pupil makes it out of this room alive."

He had no idea how to answer.

"Why aren't you terrified that the remainder of your life is being decided at this very moment?"

He really wasn't afraid; somehow he knew that he would survive. Just as well, the robot continued.

"You know what you are, deep inside. You contain within you a seed, the germ of an entire story, the story of your life and the stories of your world. It will take root one day, and it will germinate, and it will change not only you but all those around you. You will become someone..."

Suddenly the room began to glow. A white light grew brighter and brighter, until Galileo had to close his eyes.

"So you see? Do you see now?"

*page_break "No, not at all."

"No, not at all," the boy muttered. "How am I supposed to see when it's so bright here?"

The door opened.

"A Keeper of Light, Galileo Nova!" The robotic voice reverberated. Claps from outside. How long had he been in there?

What element do you think describes you best? If you don't know, consider taking a brief quiz at https://uquiz.com/GlFTZ6.

*choice
    #Light: stars, heat, nuclear forces; emotion, passion, offense
        *set persona "light"
        Light is the element of emotions and passion. Light is love. Light is struggle. Light is the fight for the sake of having a fight. It is a very popular element because the protagonist of the Chronicles has this element as his persona. Light magic in the Nebulaverse tends to be aggressive and destructive, a dance of fire and fusion.
        *choice
            #Yes, that's me!

                *goto persona_choice
    #Stone: planets, asteroids, gravity; stability, order, defense
        *set persona "stone"
        Stone is a rather less popular element, because its adherents are seen as boring and staid traditionalists. But it is also associated with bonds between close friends, loyalty, and caring for others. There has recently been a surge of Stone-wielders in the fandom who project their own vision onto the element. Stone magic revolves around defense, construction, and applications of kinetic strength, in addition to the literal manipulation of stone.
        *choice
            #Yes, that's me!

    #Metal: human ingenuity, the artificial; knowledge, logic, balance
        *set persona "metal"
        Metal is, in short, the nerd element. As such, it is quite popular. It is the negation of the animal passions in favor of rationality and thought. At its worst, metal can detach itself from reality and live in a logical palace of its own creation. Metal magic is deeply intertwined with technology; it is used in building magical-technological devices, as well as the manipulation of synthetic materials.
        *choice
            #Yes, that's me!

    #Wind: gas giants, solar winds, electromagnetism; discovery, novelty, change
        *set persona "wind"
        Wind does not conform to the world around it. Instead it is associated with realizing one's own ideas for the world, with change and dynamicism and visionary thought. It is a rather popular element, as it is the element of Capella Taikong, the protagonist's canonical(?) love interest and most popular female character. Wind magic includes the literal manipulation of gases and plasmas, as well as control over phase changes, movement, and transformations.
        *choice

    #Ice: comets, water, entropy; flexibility, survival, life and death
        *set persona "ice"
        Ice is a less popular element because it is heavily associated with death, depression, pessimism, and all those negative things. However, ice is also the element most associated with survival amidst difficult circumstances. Ice is associated with a grudging acceptance of the world around oneself, of adaptation but not "fitting in". Ice magic is associated with life and death; it includes both healing and killing magic, as well as time manipulation and more literal applications of ice and water.
        *choice
            #Yes, that's me!

                *goto persona_choice

*label role_choice

In addition to elements, each mage is assigned a Role. Basically, it is a job, or rather a category of jobs. A role describes how a mage uses their element. Where the persona is internal, the role is external. Where the persona describes "what" and "why", the role describes "how".

And what is your role? If you don't know, you can take a quiz at https://uquiz.com/ifqBq5.

*choice
    #Augur: the scientist
        *set role "augur"
        The Augur is always a popular role among the nerds who comprise the Nebulaverse fandom. Augurs are supposed to be the scientists and theorycrafters, the people who come up with ways of making sense of their element. Their role is only to interpret the world, not to change it.
        
        *if (persona = "metal")
            As an Augur of Metal, you are essentially the "nerd of nerds". The Augur of Metal is often stereotyped as a mad scientist, a creature of pure intellect completely detached from physical reality, whose only rule is their own sense of rationality. You might be brilliant, or you might be something of a kook, or both.
        *elseif (persona = "light")
            The Augurs of Light are the poets and artists. Often ensconsed in bubbles of their own creation, they turn their complex inner worlds into works for external consumption. Augurs of Light are the most popular class in the fandom, according to at least one survey.
        *elseif (persona = "stone")
            Augurs of Stone are students of humanity. Their motivation is to try to understand the people around them, through either formal psychology or more informal study. They are deeply empathetic at best, but they can also use their skills for manipulation.
        *elseif (persona = "wind")
            Augurs of Wind, like Capella Taikong from the Chronicles, tend to be independent thinkers with a strong cynical streak. Often dilettantes who have no use for discipline, they jump from one special interest to another.
        *elseif (persona = "ice")
            Augurs of Ice can be summed up as the "sad nerds". Wracked by self-doubt and prone to constant introspection, they are often deep thinkers. In the sciences, they favor biology or mathematics. Alternatively, they might favor history and philosophy.
        *choice
            #Yes, that's me!

            #Go back
                *goto role_choice
    #Keeper: the guardian
        *set role "keeper"
        Despite being the role of the protagonist, the Keeper is not a very popular role among the fandom; perhaps due to the misconception that Keepers are basically magical cops. According to most theories, however, Keepers of different elements can act very differently; most Keepers are not enforcers of rules, but rather preservers of values. 

        *if (persona = "metal")
            Keeper of Metal roughly means "preserver of knowledge". You are an encyclopedist, an archivist, a master of facts and trivia. You know everything there is about the magic of the Nebulaverse.
        *elseif (persona = "light")
            A Keeper of Light is someone who defends the values they hold dear. Like the protagonist Galileo Nova, they are often idealists who alternatively support and struggle with the established order. In other words, they are a protagonist archetype.
        *elseif (persona = "stone")
            A Keeper of Stone is a preserver of tradition, bonds, and the status quo. They are loyal friends and allies. Despite being stereotyped as the coppiest of cops, they usually value their small community more than the law.
        *elseif (persona = "wind")
            Keepers of Wind are individuals whose deepest value is their own freedom. They have a tendency to be loners, hermits, and wanderers, travelling wherever the wind takes them, with few attachments anywhere.
        *elseif (persona = "ice")
            A Keeper of Ice is a guardian of the domain of time, life, and death. They often see the outside world as a hostile place, and for good reason. They are survivors first and foremost, and are often deeply private and even secretive individuals.
        *choice
            #Yes, that's me!
                *goto persona_role_end
            #Go back
                *goto role_choice
    #Reaper: the fighter and rebel
        *set role "reaper"
        In the Nebulaverse, Reapers are magi who use their element for aggression. They comprise the Academy's militia and the Empire's armies, and are the largest component of rebels against the Empire. They often struggle against the values of their element, sometimes almost acting as its negation. This has lead to an amount of fandom drama about the true nature of the Reaper role.

        *if (persona = "metal")
            Reapers of Metal are strategists who utilize their knowledge to win battles, whether on the physical battlefield of war or a more metaphorical battlefield. Alternatively, they might be "destroyers" of Metal, people who destroy knowledge with disinformation.
        *elseif (persona = "light")
            Reapers of Light can be idealistic rebels or devoted soldiers for their chosen cause. But they can also rebel against their own sense of idealism, developing a cynical streak and becoming subservient to their superiors.
        *elseif (persona = "stone")
            Reapers of Stone might be devoted fighters for their friends and allies. Or else they might invert their Stone persona, becoming the kinds of people who purposefully try to destroy the relationships of others.
        *elseif (persona = "wind")
            Reapers of Wind are unpredictable and chaotic, jumping from one cause to another. They might be criminals or rogues. But they might also seek to destroy the freedom of others as spies and infiltrators.
        *elseif (persona = "ice")
            Reapers of Ice, such as Bruno Helios from canon, are one of the most destructively capable classes of magi. They tend to be attuned to the darker aspects of the Ice element, towards death and entropy. They struggle deeply with their own mortality and have a tendency to lash out.
        *choice
            #Yes, that's me!
                *goto persona_role_end
            #Go back
                *goto role_choice
    #Speaker: the communicator
        *set role "speaker"
        In the Nebulaverse, Speakers work as the teachers and teaching assistants of the Academy. Their hat is communicating the values of their element to others, leading others along their path. They are involved not just in literally "speaking", but also in writing, media, and art. In the fandom, Speaker is a somewhat popular role because of the preponderance of theater kids.

        *if (persona = "metal")
            Speakers of Metal are "teachers of knowledge". They are in some ways the archetypal university professor or academy teacher, knowledgeable and deeply interested in communicating their knowledge.
        *elseif (persona = "light")
            Speakers of Light are often people who put their ideals to practice as activists and politicians. They are charismatic communicators and eloquent speakers and writers who try to spread their values to others.
        *elseif (persona = "stone")
            A Speaker of Stone, like Tycho Planetes from the Nebulaverse, is often a leader of their circle of friends. They are often gregarious individuals and social butterflies who can gather a devoted following.
        *elseif (persona = "wind")
            Speakers of Wind are a class often associated with the theater kids in the fandom. They enjoy placing themselves into different roles, as actors or performers, often to the detriment of having a stable personal identity.
        *elseif (persona = "ice")
            Speakers of Ice are often healers and soothsayers, prophets and priests. They use their connection to time, life, and death like a gift of prophecy. In the Nebulaverse, they usually lead the equivalents of religious orders.
        *choice
            #Yes, that's me!
                *goto persona_role_end
            #Go back
                *goto role_choice
    #Weaver: the creator
        *set role "weaver"
        Weavers are often seen as a rather boring role by the fandom because they are often thought of as overly practical, straightforward types. But as with all of the other classes, weavers have a variety of interests and personalities. Their raison d'etre is to help people through the application of their element, by creating durable works.

        *if (persona = "metal")
            A Weaver of Metal, like Astra Van Allen from the Chronicles, is someone who applies knowledge for the betterment of others. They are often engineers, artisans, and builders, but can also be doctors, teachers, or scholars.
        *elseif (persona = "light")
            Weavers of Light are often writers and visual artists. Their goal is to illuminate peoples' hearts through art, to help people see the world in a new light. Alternatively, they use their creations to work through their own feelings and bring them out to the world.
        *elseif (persona = "stone")
            Weavers of Stone are the hearts of their circles of friends, the people who do the boring but necessary work of maintaining bonds between different people. They are mediators and peacekeepers.
        *elseif (persona = "wind")
            Weavers of Wind are highly creative artists, craftspeople, and entrepreneurs. Their goal is often to change the world through their works, whether that work happens to be in art or technology.
        *elseif (persona = "ice")
            Weavers of Ice most often work as doctors, medics, or healers; they use their understanding of life and death to save lives. In the Nebulaverse, healing magic is heavily associated with this class.
        *choice
            #Yes, that's me!
                *goto persona_role_end

How am I supposed to have time to write while taking 4 ap classes? I really wish we could put fanfic experience on our college apps. But I guess I need to do well in, like, actual school if I want to get out of here for college.

How do I get my parents to stop making me get a haircut without letting them know why I don't want a haircut. They literally said that I would "look like a girl" if I let my hair grow any longer. Like, obviously that's the whole point but I can't just say that...

So, I've spent a long time researching this theory... Please read it and tell me what you think!

Title: Gali Nova is transfem-coded and here's why:

Tl;dr: The name "Gali", being trapped in a literal closet and forced to confront your true feelings about yourself, being trapped in a closet again (on multiple occasions), feeling more at ease when around the girls up to the point of staying in their dorm (in like the most non-sexual way possible), "cross-dressing" in a way that's *not* portrayed as offensive or degrading, being naturally able to use both Light and Shadow magic, and yeah. And, of course, the Kingdomite Device subplot (yes I know it's problematic just bear with me).

Really interesting points OP! I don't agree with everything here but this would be a cool idea. Here are some comments:

A reminder that all closeted queer people are valid! If you feel like you can't come out for whatever reason, that's okay! If you don't feel safe or comfortable coming out in real life, it doesn't make you any less of who you are.

Thank you! But no, I don't. I see it as a complete series, and I don't see how it can be expanded. Sorry if this is disappointing!

To all the moralists in the Nebulaverse fandom, I hope you know that you are misguided at best, actively malicious at worst. I hope you can realize that defining certain story types as "problematic" you are actively pushing people away from this community, and you are making people's experiences here worse.

Anonymous asked: Hey, I love your blog! Just wondering, since I'm a big fan of the Sherlock TV series, what's the mage class of Sherlock Holmes and John Watson?

Thank you! For Sherlock, I would have to assign him as an [i]Augur of Wind[/i] (like Capella, you ask? Yes but no; obviously not all Augurs of Wind are the same).

Perhaps it's an obvious stereotype, but the Augur is the role that's always about seeking out the truth, about learning, so it's kind of too obvious as a detective. Now, the persona is a bit harder. Metal would be the one that jumps out, because Metal is all about knowledge and logic, but I don't think that works for him, because Metal is more about the abstract, which Sherlock is not about at all; he's very much grounded in reality. I think Wind fits because Sherlock is kind of a polymath who knows a lot about everything.

But that's just a surface-level analysis. With the persona, the real question is about [i]why[/i]: why is Sherlock? And I don't really know! I don't think we really get too much of a sense of his intrinsic motivations in the series yet?

And as for Watson? [i]Keeper of Stone[/i], of course.

What do you think? Feel free to leave suggestions in the comments!

Karla @trappedinspace is a recent mutual. She seems unsympathetic to much of the fandom as it exists.

Help a twoc out! Hey my name's Phoebe and I'm close to becoming homeless. I just got fired for not being a "culture fit" and my landlord's threatening to evict me if I don't pay up. Thank you! Any bit helps.

So, I've spent a long time researching this theory... Please read it and tell me what you think!

Title: Gali Nova is transfem-coded and here's why:

Tl;dr: The name "Gali", being trapped in a literal closet and forced to confront your true feelings about yourself, being trapped in a closet again (on multiple occasions), feeling more at ease when around the girls up to the point of staying in their dorm (in like the most non-sexual way possible), "cross-dressing" in a way that's *not* portrayed as offensive or degrading, being naturally able to use both Light and Shadow magic, and yeah.

[The image is a tapestry of the main cast of the Chronicles. They are in space, wearing their Academy uniforms, holding hands in a chain. Gali is at the front, looking at Bruno. Then it's Tycho, Astra, Capella, and finally the Administrator.]

You wake up...

"Someone certainly decided to take their time napping."

You wake up from an uncomfortable position. A person is standing over you, a girl wearing the uniform of the Pulsar Academy, with its navy blazer and black skirt.

"Anyway, the experiment with the new Kingdomite technology is underway," Astra says. Her soft voice brings you back to reality. "I've been studying it extensively, and I know how to activate it now."

"Oh. That's great. Yeah." You rub your forehead as you finally remember who you are.

You are...

Now that you remember who you are, maybe you could go back to thinking about what Astra is saying.

"You don't even know what I'm talking about, do you?" she says.

"Um, sorry..."

"Come on, we need you for the next part of this project." Astra pulls you by the arm, from the library you found yourself in, through the sunlit corridors of the academy, to the labs where she always seemed to make her home. Metal magic courses through labyrinthine machinery, illuminating the otherwise bleak surroundings in a dazzling prism of color.

*fake_choice
    #"Where are we going?"
        "Where are we going?" you ask.

        "To the Metalbound Special Projects Lab, of course! Haven't you been there for your labs?"

        "Um, should I have been?"

        Astra rolls her eyes. "I forgot that you had that special dispensation."
    #"What is this project, exactly?"
        "What is this project, exactly?" you ask.

        "We are going to be one step closer to uncovering the secrets of the universe. Universes, rather. It's a new technology that lets us... well, you'll see. I don't know either."
    #"How long was I asleep for?"
        "How long was I asleep for?" you ask.

        "Too long," Astra replies. "It's past midday."

        "Oh. Sorry."

        She just shrugs. "It's fine."

"Anyway, we're here now."

You finally see Astra's device with your own eyes. At first it appears to be nothing more than a door, with a simple frame detached from any walls, a handle, and hinges on one side. But then you see the wires and tubes snaking out, not looking like part of the door at all. They connect to another device, this one like a large metal barrel, topped by flashing lights and buttons and screens, a control panel of sorts.

All your other friends are already here: Bruno, Tycho, and Capella. Bruno just glares at you, while Tycho gives you a small wave and sheepish smile. Capella is checking the device by herself.

            #Don't dignify him with a response.
                You ignore his gaze as best as you can. He stops staring after a moment.

        "Astra, let it be on the record that I am still opposed to this project," remarks Bruno, "despite what the Administrator might have said."

        Astra sighs once more. "Look, the Kingdomites have multiverse traversal down to a spell. A few spells actually. Don't you remember them from class? Don't you remember anything from class?"

        To be honest, you don't exactly remember the spells either...

                She goes on and on, but you do eventually learn the formulae involved in multiversal travel. You don't understand exactly how the spells are supposed to be applied, but you don't think Astra does either.
            #Just forget about it.
                "You know what, forget about it," says Bruno. He folds his arms and turns away. "If you die, you die."

                "We're not going to die!" shouts Astra, but neither of their hearts are in this argument.

        "So, do you know anything about parallel worlds?" Astra asks. You shake your head. "Well, our current hypothesis is that the machine will transport us into a parallel world, somewhere in the multiverse. It would be the first time for any Imperial citizen. Of course we don't have 100% certainty, but the Kingdomites apparently wrote a lot about that kind of thing. Anyway, here's a translation of one of their pamphlets." She hands you a tablet.
        *fake_choice
            #Read the pamphlet.
                You read the translated Kingdomite pamphlet. It talks about some of the experiences of people who have visited parallel universes and returned.

But you do get a sense that interacting with the parallel universe will be difficult once you're in it, unless you use a special spell. The pamphlet doesn't exactly describe the spell, however.

Astra smiles at the other girl. "Ella, would you do the honors?"

Capella doesn't take a second glance, and presses the red button. Beeps and mechanical whines begin, and grow louder. The door swings open, revealing a swirling painting of colors. Nothing is visible beyond, but Capella reaches her hand through and pulls it back.

"Well, my hand's fine," she says with a shrug. "What are we waiting for?" She steps through.

[b]IRL[/b]

You just had an incredible idea for a fanfiction.

Maybe it's time to finally start writing, to put to paper (or silicon, rather) the words that just streamed through your mind.. Ah, yes. Your as-yet-theoretical magnum opus. The story that will become your 5th Symphony of Nebulaverse fanfiction, one that will stand out among the over one hundred thousand other stories for this fandom (almost two hundred more were published since yesterday). A metafictional masterpiece to rival Borges, more revelatory of the human condition than Le Guin, with a scope more epic than Tolkien.

*label story_title_choice
What will you title the story?

*choice
    #Fragments of the Multiverse
        *set story_title "Fragments of the Multiverse"
        *set story_title_short "Fragments"
        That sounds familiar for some reason, as if it's a play off something you've read before and can't remember. But at least it isn't based on a song lyric. Or is it?
    #Another Day, Another Time
        *set story_title "Another Day, Another Time"
        *set story_title_short "ADAT"
        Huh. Interesting you thought of that just now. It's a rather generic phrase, but one that hasn't been used in the fandom thus far.
    #A Paradox Between Worlds
        *set story_title "A Paradox Between Worlds"
        *set story_title_short "APBW"
        The title sounds familiar for some reason, as if it's based on something you've read before and can't remember. Is it a song lyric or something? Well, a quick search shows that there aren't any other fics with that title, so you should be good.
    #A Meander of Shadows
        *set story_title "A Meander of Shadows"
        *set story_title_short "Meander"
        That's an interesting title. No results on Google, too. Kind of a word salad, because you have no idea what a "Meander of Shadows" would look like. But then again, the same can be said of your story.
    #Quantum Interference
        *set story_title "Quantum Interference"
        *set story_title_short "QI"
        This title is at least somewhat relevant to the whole "multiverse" idea. You feel like it would be common, but apparently it hasn't been used in this fandom so far. Great.
    #The Metafictional Hypothesis
        *set story_title "The Metafictional Hypothesis"
        *set story_title_short "TMH"
        This is a bit of a pretentious title, and it alludes to academic concepts that, to be honest, you don't really understand. But it's unique.

Stories need ships; relationships between fictional characters (or non-fictional individuals, but we don't talk about that here) are the key driver behind fandom. There are some inklings of ships present already. Will you designate a primary ship for the story?

*choice
    #Brunova
        Brunova is probably the most popular ship in the fandom, so it's a safe choice. There are hundreds if not thousands of blogs and fic authors devoted solely to this ship to the exclusion of anything else in the Nebulaverse. Of course it has its refractors, but they are mostly marginal. Claire is one of the biggest writers for this ship, and Lux is a writer and fan. Sofia has also written for Brunova.

        *if (protag_cis_girl or protag_trans_girl)
            Making Gali a girl in this story might be viewed somewhat negatively, as if she suddenly became a Mary Sue. Some people might uncharitably call it homophobic.
        *if (protag_trans_girl)
            But a trans girl Gali might add some interesting things to the dynamic, if only because trans girl Brunova hasn't been done before.

        Tychonova is a rather popular ship, less so than the juggernaut that is Brunova, but respectable. Perhaps a cruiser-tier ship, or something like that. It's a rather uncontroversial ship that people enjoy even when they don't actively ship it.

        Brunastra is a strange construct with little canonical narrative backing, but it is decently popular nevertheless, surpassing the more "canonical" Astranova and Ellanova. Its detractors sometimes say that Bruno is abusive towards Astra due to their oft-antagonistic relationship, while its proponents seem to enjoy a "bad boy" romance with change and redemption.
