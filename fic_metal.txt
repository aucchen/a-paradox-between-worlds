*if look
    The surroundings are familiar. Intimately so. It's the Pulsar Academy's central library. You must've been asleep at the table again.

*if listen
    It's quiet. But as you listen more you hear the familiar sounds of the library: the shuffling of books, soft footsteps, whispers among the stacks.

*if smell
    Your nostrils are filled with the musty odor of old paper.

*if taste
    It tastes of cherries once again. You're thirsty. How long has it been since you last consumed a real meal?

*if touch
    The table is hard and cool. Your uniform is still starchy. Your body aches. How long has it been since you last slept?

*if think
    Are you finally back home? Will it be like you've never left? Will your old friends be here, and will they be the same? Or is this a time loop, where you've woken up before you ever entered the portal?

You manage to stand up, despite your achy body. A familiar face soon approaches you. It's... Astra? She looks much the same as before, and wears the Pulsar Academy's uniform

        "Yeah I guess. After going through the portal I ended up in a few different places. Sometimes better, sometimes worse. But I always left after no more than a day. Until I ended up back here. It's like I never left."
    #Ask: What is this place?
        "What is this place?"

        "Back at the Pulsar Academy, of course!" She laughs. "After going through the portal I ended up in a few different places. Sometimes better, sometimes worse. But I always left after no more than a day. Until I ended up back here. It's like I never left."

        Astra shakes her head. "No. There are some differences. This is a peaceful place. As far as I know, the Administrator is still alive. There's no civil war. The Emperor hasn't..." She pauses and looks at you. "It's a better world than the one we came from. But don't worry, there are still problems to solve, mysteries to interrogate."

        Astra shrugs. "I don't know. Maybe that's for you to decide. I don't know how I ended up staying here, but it was just... right, you know?"

        "No, I don't know."

        "We'll meet our other friends," says Astra. "They don't remember you, but don't worry, I told them all about you!"

"Is everyone else here?"

"Yeah. They're probably all in the club room!"

You follow Astra through the labyrinthine corridors of the Academy, until you end up in the empty classroom that so often served as your meeting place. The rest of the gang is there: Bruno, Tycho, and Capella. They smile and wave towards you.

"Welcome to the Mystery Club!" exclaims Tycho. "Astra's told us a great deal about you, about who you were back in your original world. There's a special mystery that we saved just for you!"

Suddenly, you feel tired. It's as if all of the strength has drained out of your body, or perhaps you've just caught up on all the exhaustion of the previous worlds. You have no energy left for this, nothing within you to help the Mystery Club or anything...

[A/N: you're feeling tired...]

        Astra frowns. "Oh? Why?"

            #I'm tired.
                "I'm tired," you say. "I just... want to rest, I guess."

                "Oh. So, what do you want to do? Do you want to find a place to sleep?"

                "Um, maybe? I just want to..."

                        "Yeah, I just want to take a nap..."

                        Astra laughs. "Right! Yeah, taking care of your physiological needs! You must be tired from all the universe hopping. We'll find a room for you."

                        She leaves the classroom, and you follow her to the dorms.

                        *goto peaceful_world
                    #Exit this world. Just move on from this place.
                        "I just want to move on. If this isn't my home, then I don't want to stay here any longer than I have to."

                        "Oh." Astra sighs. "That isn't how it works. You should know that yet. You can only leave when something has been achieved, when you've done something in this world."

                        "Then can I at least rest?"

                        "Sure, you can."

                        She leaves the classroom, and you follow.

                        "Great! This is the mystery of the..."

                        You can't do this. Your eyes cannot stay open. Your body is too tired.

You dream of falling, of a cavity opening up beneath your bed and sucking you in. Or perhaps it's not a dream. Perhaps it's reality, and you're finally leaving this world...

        Anyway, given the discord in the nebulaverse fandom at this moment, perhaps it wouldn't hurt to just post an incomplete and kind of bad chapter of the story? 

        Sure. It's better to have a story out there than locked up in your head, right? Right?
    #Just shut up and post it already.
        Okay. It's posted. Now to watch the notes roll in... eventually.
