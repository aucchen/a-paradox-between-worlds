    #Gali is me, $!{handle}. Gali is a reflection of myself.

        [Okay. Gali is a self-insert character.]
    #Gali is the creation of G.T. Macmillan, and I'm trying to portray Gali similar to her depiction.
        *set protag_personality "canon"
        [Okay, The Gali in this story should be the same as Gali from the canon.]
    #Gali has a true personality that even GTM doesn't always realize.
        *set protag_personality "noncanon"
        [Okay, Gali]
    #Gali is literally just some guy.
        [Okay. Gali is just some guy.]

    #She's the smart girl, right?
        [Astra is ]
    #She's a fundamentally caring person who doesn't really know how to deal with awkward situations and ends up in over her head.
    #She is a seemingly kind girl with a secret dark side.
        [Sure. Some have said that she was captured and tortured/brainwashed by Emperor Ariel in Book 4 Part 3; others have said that she]
    #She doesn't need to have a personality, since she's not the main character.
        [Okay. Astra is not the main character.]

    #She's the other smart girl, right? Like Astra?
        [Sure. Capella has basically the same personality as Astra, which is... "smart girl".]
    #She is pessimistic, deeply philosophical, and has a stoic veneer hiding her vulnerabilities. In other words, an Augur of Ice.
    #She doesn't need to have a personality because she's not the main character.
    #She's a lesbian.
        [That's not a personality though...]
        *choice
            #Maybe her personality is something else.
                [Okay, what is Capella's characterization?]

                *goto capella
            #She's a lesbian and also trans. That is a personality, right?
                That's not a personality either...

    #He's a jerk with a heart of gold.
        [Okay, Bruno is a jerk with a heart of gold. He's mean, but he secretly cares deeply about his friends, especially Gali, despite their rivalry.]

        [This is the standard fanon depiction of Gali.]
    #He's a jerk with a heart of jerk.
        [Okay, Bruno is a pure jerk. He's just an ass.]
    #He secretly cares about Gali but is torn by his social status and external obligations.
        [Bruno is a complicated character.]
    #He's gay.
        [Wait... being gay is not a personality.]
        *fake_choice
            #Maybe his personality is something else.
                [Okay. What is Bruno's characterization?]

                *goto bruno_character_choices
            #It is for Bruno.
                [Okay, sure, being gay can be a personality for Bruno. Fortunately, a good chunk of the fandom agrees with you.]
            #He's gay and he's a jerk. That's his personality.
                [Okay. Bruno's personality consists solely of the facts that he's gay and he's a jerk. A gay jerk. A gerk, if you will.]
