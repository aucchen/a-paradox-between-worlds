[b]Excerpt from [i]Chronicles of the Shadow Nebula, Book 2: Planetary Dreams[/i] by G. T. Macmillan[/b]

Gali slipped on the goggles. Just as Astra had described, he saw his friends as silhouettes of different colors. Tycho was a deep navy blue. Bruno was lime green. Astra was violet. And Capella was gray with a purple tinge.

"What does this all mean?" asked Tycho.

"You understand how all colors are a combination of red, green, and blue?" began Astra, but Bruno cut in.

"I thought all colors were made of yellow, cyan, and magenta," said the boy.

*page_break Astra sighed.

Astra sighed. "Those are subtractive colors, for ink. These are additive colors, for light. Anyway, my point was, each of the primary colors you see in a person represent how they perceive of you. Blue for friendship, red for love, and green for enmity. Blue plus red makes magenta, blue plus green makes cyan, and red plus green makes yellow. Those mean exactly what you'd guess."

Bruno jutted in again. "Huh, I didn't know you were-"

"Shut up! Anyway, my point was, this could be a useful tool for understanding each other, so there will never be uncertainty about where we stand."

Capella and Tycho had both ripped off their goggles.

*page_break "This isn't right."

"This isn't right," said Tycho, his soft voice quivering. "No one should have this knowledge. To peer into another's soul like this, it feels perverse. It feels wrong."

Capella nodded. "This toy is just another prison. Right now, Astra, I just saw your color darken, just by a tinge. You disagree with me. What if we were constantly aware of how each other felt? Wouldn't it be paralyzing, to be always worrying about how you're perceived? How could one ever act?"

But Bruno just shrugged. "I don't see what's so wrong. Isn't it better for us to keep each other honest?"

"For once I agree with the brute," said Astra.

"So your color is-"

"Shut up!"

*page_break Gali was silent...

Gali was silent throughout this discourse. He did not know what to think. He wondered what color he appeared as in their eyes. But part of him did not want to know. It was terrifying, being perceived in others' eyes. It was like being naked.

What if they saw through his hard exterior, and discovered the parts of him that he could never admit, even to himself?

Help my grandmother stay alive!

Hey everyone, my abuela in Mexico has just been diagnosed with a brain tumor. There's a surgical procedure that could save her life, but they only do that procedure in a few hospitals in America, and none in Mexico. The problem is, it's going to cost us tens of thousands of dollars. I don't know if we can ever afford that.

Can anyone help us out?

Thank you so much!

As a reminder i'm open to fic/art commissions to pay for my abuela's cancer treatment! We can negotiate rates! For examples of my art, see below! No nsf/w or gore, and I can't do furry or detailed machinery.

A reminder that the actors have actively rejected GTM's transphobia. Most of the fandom is on our side.

I won't lie, this has been a difficult time for us. There's been a number of cancellations for Nebulacon. At this point I'm not sure if we will be able to bring the full show that we promised. I truly apologize if that's something you've been looking forward to.

Anyway, in totally unrelated news, I'm working on the next chapter of Mars, Bringer of War. It should be out soon.

[b]@shadow-protectrix reblogged from @noncanonical at 9:00 PM. OP: @noncanonical[/b]

The reason I am boycotting GT*M's products is because she is using her resources to directly harm the lives of trans people in the UK. She is personally bankrolling multiple lawsuits aimed at excluding trans women from women's spaces, and legalizing the harassment of trans people anywhere. She is donating to politicians who want to do the same, and trying to defeat trans-inclusive politicians, even those in her party. Her foundation is giving grants to avowedly anti-trans organizations that spread reactionary conspiracy theories about trans people. Giving her money at this point is a vote in favor of these actions. I would in fact say that if you support trans rights in the UK, it is unethical to keep on funding her.

[b]@shadow-protectrix:[/b]

Do you think your boycott will actually work? How many people will agree? Will this actually do anything to help trans people?

A notice: as of today, we will no longer be updating this blog. Many of us running this blog are trans, and the author's comments and behaviors have led to a hostile environment towards trans members of the fandom. After a discussion with the mods, we have come to the understanding that we can no longer participate in Nebulaverse fandom in good conscience. 

[b]@shadow-protectrix:[/b]

Guys, come on. Do you really think a boycott would work? Is this the best use of our time and effort as a fandom?

Please, everyone, let's take one big, deep, breath. Everything is going to be okay.

GTM said some things that a lot of us disagree with, maybe even consider personally offensive. I'm not asking people to agree with her, or even stop thinking of what she said as offensive. I'm asking you to take a step back, and remember that G. T. Macmillan is a real person, just like you. She is a human being with feelings, and she has been a victim too.

Just have a little empathy, please?

It really sucks that gtm is like this, but I feel like what sucks more is that it's almost like she failed to learn the main lesson from her own books. The books were all about challenging established narratives and authorities, about questioning what you've been told since you were born. Above all, it's about the possibility for change, about questioning if and how society can be changed for the better. And apparently gtm completely forgot about this when it came to trans people existing!

How can you put your own self-aggrandizement above the needs of some of the most vulnerable members of the fandom? Are you worried at all about promoting transphobia?

[b]@trappedinspace reblogged from @noncanonical at 11:30 PM. OP: @noncanonical[/b]

The reason I am boycotting GT*M's products is because she is using her resources to directly harm the lives of trans people in the UK. She is personally bankrolling multiple lawsuits aimed at excluding trans women from women's spaces, and legalizing the harassment of trans people anywhere. She is donating to politicians who want to do the same, and trying to defeat trans-inclusive politicians, even those in her party. Her foundation is giving grants to avowedly anti-trans organizations that spread reactionary conspiracy theories about trans people. Giving her money at this point is a vote in favor of these actions. I would in fact say that if you support trans rights in the UK, it is unethical to keep on funding her.

[b]@shadow-protectrix:[/b]

Do you think your boycott will actually work? How many people will agree? Will this actually do anything to help trans people?

[b]@noncanonical:[/b]

I don't know if it will work. But I have a conscience. Even if I am only doing this for myself, I cannot support her work.

Please, everyone, let's take one big, deep, breath. Everything is going to be okay.

GTM said some things that a lot of us disagree with, maybe even consider personally offensive. I'm not asking people to agree with her, or even stop thinking of what she said as offensive. I'm asking you to take a step back, and remember that G. T. Macmillan is a real person, just like you. She is a human being with feelings, and she has been a victim too.

Just have a little empathy, please?

[b]@redcapella:[/b]

Did you miss the part where she is bankrolling lawsuits to ban trans women from public spaces where we have historically been allowed? This isn't about "offense". None of us would care what she was saying if she were some rando. It's about a political war against our right to exist, which she is directly exacerbating.

Also I thought you were nonbinary, which is something she literally calls a "social contagion"? Do you have no self respect?

Hatsune Miku wrote the Chronicles of the Shadow Nebula.

[b]@noncanonical:[/b]

No. GTM wrote Chronicles of the Shadow Nebula. She is a transphobe, she wrote a series of books we enjoyed, and she is still profiting from us and investing her financial resources and social capital into political efforts to curb trans rights no matter what bizarre rationalizations we use to justify our continued support of her.

Okay one last post bc I'm about to die from reading all these fricking asks

God fuck gtm. Just fuck her for posting that shit. So many fuckin fancy words just to say that you hate trans people. I hope all transphobes die and this includes GTM.

[b]@shadow-protectrix:[/b] 

This is not an appropriate thing to say. No matter what you feel, it's horrible to wish harm on people.

[b]@macmillan-gt:[/b]

Thank you, Claire, for calling out violent threats against women.

[b]@reaper-of-byblos:[/b] 

Are you happy now @shadow-protectrix? Are you happy that you directed a transphobic hate mob against a girl who happened to make an off-the-cuff post in response to her own harassment? Are you proud of yourself?

[b]@trappedinspace:[/b] 

Luna literally tagged the post don't reblog. What the fuck are you doing.

@trappedinspace: Hey @lunan0va I'm really sorry about the messages you've been getting. Is there anything we can do to help?

@lunan0va: i'm fine. really.

@trappedinspace: Also should I delete that one reblog? Or any reblog for that matter? Sorry I got kinda carried away...

@lunan0va: nah. it's already spread enough that it doesn't really make a difference lmao

@lunan0va: i've deleted the op, not that anyone cares i guess. i shouldn't wish death on people. i get that.

@apocalypse-hoarder: WOW the way Claire reblogged from Luna was so out of line. Want me to yell at them for you? I can write up a callout.

@lunan0va: idk...

@lunan0va: idk if that would help, you know? I don't really want to be like, the instigator of drama. More than I already am lol

@trappedinspace: yeah Claire fucking sucks. But, like, Claire isn't the real target. GTM is still ultimately responsible for all this.

@trappedinspace: Maybe to stem the tide it'd be better if you just closed all asks and deleted them instead of posting them. Make your blog private if need be. Delete and remake it even.

@apocalypse-hoarder: wow this is patronizing as fuck. Luna don't let the haters get you down.

@trappedinspace: I've been through this shit before. I've seen waves of harassment like this before, and I've been on the websites where they organize. The best way to deal with them is to deny them views.

@apocalypse-hoarder: you are literally telling her what to do with her life. What kind of arrogance is that?

@trappedinspace: posting the hate messages just gives them a bigger platform. Don't let them have that. Also you don't have to engage in anything that hurts you.

@lunan0va: sorry but can you people stop talking like i'm not here

@shadow-protectrix: Not as many as you'd think, guessing from the discourse.

@shadow-protectrix: But enough to put a dent in the schedule. Hari @noncanonical started the "movement". A bunch of artists are dropping out too or said they're thinking about it. @monadcore and @cyanstars said they'll probably cancel. Probably others too.

@nebulascribbler: Well that's unfortunate. I hope the show can still go on.

@shadow-protectrix: I'm glad you're standing with me :)

@trappedinspace: Looking back at their blog archive, they literally did not make a single original post before the latest gtm incident. All of their posts had been queued.

@trappedinspace: And they haven't posted or reblogged anything that's not about gtm/the incident since.

@trappedinspace: And one more thing, I found an archive of the blog from over a year ago and they were still 17 then, so they're lying about their age probably. [link to wayback machine]

You've decided to contact Claire about Sofia's plan.

@you: hey claire?

@shadow-protectrix: Yes $!{handle}?

@you: sofia told me something about you...

@shadow-protectrix: Was it about NebulaCon? How she wants to take it over from me?

@you: yeah...

@shadow-protectrix: And she wanted to rope you into her plan to push me to stop being the public face of NebulaCon?

@you: yeah...

@shadow-protectrix: *sigh*

@shadow-protectrix: Of course.

@shadow-protectrix: Welp, thanks for telling me. I got the impression that she was recruiting other people into her little thingy but I didn't know who it would be.

        *set claire_blue %+ 4
        @you: so um... will you agree to what she wants?

        @shadow-protectrix: No. Never.

        @shadow-protectrix: Between you and me, I'm not her biggest fan.
        
        @shadow-protectrix: I think she just wants attention, the adoration of thousands of screaming fans and stuff like that.

        @shadow-protectrix: I do too, of course. But at least I don't try to hide it. At least I don't make up weird schemes to backstab my ostensible friend.

        @shadow-protectrix: Don't you want that, too? Doesn't everyone?
        *fake_choice
            #I do...
                @you: yeah i guess.

                @shadow-protectrix: I really understand that impulse.
            #I don't know what I want...
                @you: idk what i want...

                @shadow-protectrix: That's okay.
                
                
                @shadow-protectrix: You will someday.
            #I don't want fame at all.
                @you: nah. i don't want fame at all.

                @shadow-protectrix: So you're content to just slink about in the shadows? Creating content that only a handful of people would ever see and even fewer would care about?

                @you: i guess?

                @shadow-protectrix: Well, then you're more humble than I could ever be.

                @shadow-protectrix: LOL

You've decided to tell Karla about Sofia's plan, because it might be useful for her investigation.

@you: hey karla?

@trappedinspace: yeah?

@you: not sure if this is useful for your investigation into @apocalypse-hoarder, but sofia @nebulascribbler messaged me.

@trappedinspace: lol why?

@you: she told me that she's trying to get Claire @shadow-protectrix to give up nebulacon to her. and she wanted me to help her.

@trappedinspace: How did she want you to help her?

@you: by reblogging a callout post for Claire

@trappedinspace: LMAO

*comment amogus
@trappedinspace: Okay, that just raises my suspicions of @nebulascribbler, but I don't think it's proof of anything. She's always kinda seemed sus to me. idk.

@trappedinspace: Looking at their blogs, Stella's been reblogging quite a bit from Sofia, but that's not proof that @apocalypse-hoarder is a sock puppet.

@trappedinspace: tbh I feel like the entire fandom mom community that includes Sofia and Claire and all those people has incredibly weird vibes but maybe that's just me.

@trappedinspace: Anyway, thanks for telling me; just keep me updated...

This is a callout post for C/l/a/i/r/e @/s/h/a/d/o/w-p/r/o/t/e/c/t/r/i/x. As an adult in the n*bul*v*rse fandom, they have a habit of apologizing for abusive relationships, forming inappropriately close ties to minors, and hostility towards trans women. CW: abuse apologia, transmisogyny

You're done with blogs for today. This website is no longer a place of honor, if it ever was. It is a dangerous and repulsive place, with nothing of value and no esteemed deeds to commemorate. The danger emanates forth like waves of energy, radiating through the field of blogs.

Thus, you go to sleep for the night.
